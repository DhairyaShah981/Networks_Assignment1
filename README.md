ReadMe Instructions:

My GitHub repository contains two folders: server and client. The client folder contains utilities.py and client.py. 
The server folder contains server.py, bruh.txt, and a folder named Images and utilities.py. 
After cloning the repository, you can open two command prompts and first run the server.py and then run the client.py to test the commands. 
You will get the outputs and prompts on both the client and server. You may note that I am currently implementing server and client on the same operating system, 
so it works like two processes communicating with each other. (Inter-Process Communication) 
Implementing the server on a different system can also work fine if we set the IP address accordingly.
When running on your system please make sure that you change the IP address in the client.py to your IP address.
